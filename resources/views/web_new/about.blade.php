                            This is more than our mantra. It is the purpose behind everything we do and the reason our
                            founder created
                            Your exercises. At a time when he was in desperate need of someone who truly cared, our
                            founder witnessed first
                            hand how those who care are held back by their technology that isn't doing what they need it
                            to do.

                <h2>
                    Let Us Tell You That Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When our founder suffered a torn ACL and a gruesome staphylococcus infection, he feared he would
                    never walk
                    again. He was weeks past the rehab timeline and people kept telling him nothing could be done. When
                    it felt like
                    all hope was lost, one physiotherapist decided to take on his severe case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though this physiotherapist could not guarantee success and had never handled a case so severe,
                    he felt he
                    couldn't just stand by and do nothing. He decided to care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As our founder went through treatment, it became apparent that the organizational system of his
                    physiotherapist's business was indeed improvement. He was so devoted to his clients, there was no
                    time for him
                    to handle billing, scheduling, charting and more. Our founder saw the same hopelessness in the
                    physiotherapist's
                    business system that he had felt with his own body, before finding help. As an IT consultant, he saw
                    that he
                    could fix the technology system and make it a lot easier for his physiotherapist to do his job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So he got to work fixing the system, then just went ahead and wrote a custom software application to
                    help manage
                    scheduling, billing, charting and documentation. Before long, word spread to other clinics about the
                    software
                    and our founder had 8 clients. He was so passionate about being able to help the health and wellness
                    community
                    that he quit his lucrative consulting job to go all in on the software. Your exercises was born. Now
                    that you know
                    our story, you understand that Your exercises is not just an electronic medical records system. It is
                    Our System
                    of Caring for the business owners, practitioners and admins who are doing life-changing and
                    life-saving work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because without someone who is willing to care, our founder may never have walked again. One person
                    decided to
                    sweat the small stuff and ask, "does it have to be this way?" and that is the same question
                    Your exercises answers
                    for our clients every day. This is our reason for being. It is the reason we chose to be there for
                    those who
                    care and it will continue to be as we grow. This is the heart behind Your exercises.
